[Opening Scene – upbeat background music, screen recording of the VueJS UI Learning App]

🎙️ Narrator (you):
"A few days ago, I shared a video showcasing a Vue.js-based learning app I built. I recently made some upgrades and added AI integration, giving users real-time assistance whenever they’re stuck on an equation or question."

[Cut to: screen showing AI helping solve a math question in the app]

🎙️ Narrator:
"It worked so well, I thought — why not build the AI into its own standalone project?"

[Transition to: “Anything AI” logo or landing page]

🎙️ Narrator:
"And just a few hours later, Anything AI was born — fully powered by Gemini. It's just like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or any other text-based AI agent you know."

[Cut to: demo interaction – user types “5 + 5” and gets a response]

🎙️ Narrator:
"Let’s do a quick demo. I’ll ask it something simple — 5 + 5..."

[Then: “How to make money in 2025” and it lists ideas]

🎙️ Narrator:
"Now let’s go a bit deeper. 'How to make money in 2025?' Boom — freelancing, data analysis, cloud computing, content creation, investing — and more. All within seconds."

[Cut to: narrator on camera or animated callout with inspiring music]

🎙️ Narrator:
"So why am I showing you this? Because I’m calling out to forward-thinking investors and business owners. This is more than a demo — it’s a glimpse into the future of AI."

[Cut to: “Opportunities with Anything AI” text + visuals of AI use cases]

🎙️ Narrator:
"Right now, Anything AI runs on Gemini — but with the right partners, we’re planning to build our own Large Language Model. Imagine an AI fully independent, tailored for real-world applications."

[Final scene: call to action – contact info / website / email]
